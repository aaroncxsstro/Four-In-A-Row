### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) - Integrated development environment (IDE)
* [JDK 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) - Java Development Kit version 1.8

### Installation

2. Import it to eclipse (Or just execute the jar file in the root of the project!)

## License

**Note:** While the general concept of the game, "Four in a Row," is not my original idea and is widely recognized as a classic game, I want to clarify that I developed all aspects of this specific implementation. The design, code, and other resources used in the game are my own creations, but the fundamental concept of a four-in-a-row game is a well-established and widely known idea.
